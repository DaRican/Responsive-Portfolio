            <img src="./assets/images/Joe_Dad-67Bday.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

            <p>I was born in Germany to military parents and spent the first 5 years of my life there. I do not speak
                German however. I am an avid outdoors man and I love to hike and ride bicycles. </p>

            <p>I am familiar with coding due to becoming acclamated to Linux OS. Of course there are multiple operating
                systems out there, but learning the CLI and making automated bash scripts help with the learning of what
                machine talk is and how syntax is very important. </p>

            <p>I look forward to completing my bootcamp with honors</p>
