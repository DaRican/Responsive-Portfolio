			<p>
				I am a current student at KU Web Development bootcamp ran by Trilogy Education Services.
				I enjoy playing sports on my free time as well as writing BASH and Python scripts to
				set up my home network to share all my files with all the internal terminals, as
				well as using wireshark to monitor any unwanted entries into my network.
				I am still a novice at it but there isn't anything that you can't find on Google
				these days.
